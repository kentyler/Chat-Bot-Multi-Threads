# Related Projects

This multi-threading strategy documentation is part of a broader collection of AI conversation enhancement tools. While not directly integrated, these repositories share similar goals of improving AI interactions through different approaches.

## Related Repositories

### ðŸ§  [Cogito](https://github.com/kentyler/cogito)
**Long-term Memory for AI Conversations**

Cogito is an experimental system that adds persistent memory to AI conversations:

- **Conversation History**: Maintains long-term context across sessions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Tracks recurring themes and participant behaviors
- **Memory Retrieval**: Recalls relevant past conversations when needed

**Similarity to Multi-Threading**: While independent, Cogito could potentially store and recall multi-threaded conversation patterns over time.

### ðŸŒŠ [Liminal Explorer](https://github.com/kentyler/liminal-explorer)
**Browser-Based AI Conversation Enhancement**

Liminal Explorer enhances web-based AI conversations through prompting and instruction modifications:

- **Automatic Prompt Enhancement**: Adds instructions to improve AI responses
- **Browser Integration**: Works across different AI chat platforms
- **Conversation Monitoring**: Tracks and enhances ongoing discussions

**Similarity to Multi-Threading**: Like multi-threading, Liminal Explorer works by adding strategic instructions and prompts to improve AI conversation quality and capabilities.

## Shared Philosophy

All three repositories reflect a common approach to AI enhancement:

- **Instruction-Based Enhancement**: Using strategic prompting rather than code modification
- **Conversation Quality**: Focusing on making AI interactions more useful and sophisticated
- **User-Controlled Tools**: Providing users with techniques they can apply themselves

## Independent Usage

Each repository can be used independently:
- **Multi-Threading**: Apply the strategies from this repo to any AI conversation
- **Cogito**: Add memory to conversations regardless of threading approach
- **Liminal Explorer**: Enhance browser-based AI chats with or without multi-threading
